# Pokémon Battle Game

A recreation of a battle from the famous Pokémon games from Nintendo. I made this early in my progress in the UNC Coding Bootcamp 2017, so I didn't use a lot of libraries and frameworks like jQuery and React that would have made this a lot easier.

## Getting Started

Just open index.html and pick a Pokémon to fight with.
